    "\n",
    "Here is an interactive Notebook to load and play directly with the Matlab code used in the MPC Monetary Experiment paper (available here), adapted from the Bogomolnaia and Moulin cake eating algorithm paper (2001). Please allow Binder to be loaded (<1 min), then you can look at the code, change parameters and run cell by cell as in any Jupyter Notebook (Maj+Enter to run each cell once, or use menu shortcut to run all cells under Cell > \"Run All\").  \n",

    "**The model used here is detailed and presented more in details in the Generic \"Cake-Eating\" based algorithms discussion notebook (https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NicolasXYZ/MPC_experiment/master?filepath=index.ipynb). We only remind the main features of the model here, before focusing on the calibration and on simulating world debts, 1945-now, and several post Covid-19 scenarii**\n",

    "\n",
    "- Time is discrete, in rounds.\n",
    "- At the start of each round each country generates one \"cake\" (debt) \n",
    "- Each country simultaneously eats each others' cakes (debt) at different speed and following different rankings (so when a piece of cake is finished the countries that were eating eat move to the item below in their rankings)\n",
    "- Each country stores what he ate in his reserves - the endowments\n",
    "- If at the end of a round a country's cake has not been completed absorbed (by itself and/or by other countries) it suffers a devaluation - i.e. every the value of pieces of cake from this country store in others' endowments is decreased, and its interest rate rises.\n",
    "- Countries' ranking preferences are function of their trading preferences, their trading partners' debts' \"safety\", interest rate, size, and some randomness. See in more details below on how rankings and cakes are generated by each country at each round, and on how endowments change according to countries' behaviours.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "We present here the detailed code used for the simulations. For that we first calibrate the model to match the main trends and events observed from 1945 to now (2020). Being able to capture these features of past history will provide confidence and intuition in the model's inner workings. That lead us to provide several scenarii in how the models' parameters will change following Covid-19's increase in debts *(these parameters from the model being for instance the change in debt levels, while debt absorption speed are maintained roughly constant. Different degrees in shifts in trade and supply chain preferences are also considered)*. We thus generate 50 more rounds after a common departing point, and report here the different outcomes, and the different probabilities of each outcome (since they are intervention of random perturbations in the model the probabilities of each outcome is calculated based on how many of different random sequence generate this specific outcome).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulations of extra Covid debts show that :\n",
    "\n",
    "- in the case of everything constant (pre Trump US and China trade relations) debts are overall sustainable, with adjustements in reserve levels of countries depending on how affected by the crisis they were\n",
    "- similar results in the case of everything constant, with just additional reliance on trade with China (for instance for masks, medical supplies etc). They are also small probabilities of increased shares of RMB within the international reserve repartition, but that comes with higher overall reserve levels for all 12 countries of the simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- in the case of everything constant among all countries except China and US, who in that scenario stop trading with each other, they are small probabilities of a global contraction (less reserves, less debts, less GDP growth) that preserves the overall shares of each country in the global economy - except for China in the global economy which suffers more. However in these small probability event the US go through an initial bubble fueled by the decrease of China, that then collapses back to the initial level (and note that after this collapse China's share is also back to the initial level - but with the cost of a global contraction, especially for all EM markets). **And with the caveat provided just above that this debt model doesn't take into account other incentives and consequences created by such dynamics - small probabilities in economic contraction in one country might leading to escalating tensions on other dimensions as well*\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Screen%20Shot%202020-04-04%20at%209.50.20%20PM.png\" /> \n",
    "\n",
    "- in the case of stopping trade between China and the US **AND** additional reliance by other countries on China, there is high probability for a sudden takeover of the role of the US as reserve currency China, accompanied by strong contraction for every other country. **Again, with the previous caveat of unaccounted destabilizing geopolitical consequences**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Screen%20Shot%202020-04-04%20at%209.57.55%20PM.png\" /> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- finally, in the case of our proposed stabilization scheme *(details in the paper - in the model it is just reflected as more willingness from participating countries to accept others' devaluation - see the commented code in the last cells of this notebook. Un-implemented here is also the extra information each country will have on how much latitude they will have at each round on their debt, which should also help in addition of the effects produced here to stabilize debts, interest rates and balance global reserve currencies)* the effects of all above scenarii are smoothen, with much more balanced reserve currencies (at least 3 currencies accounting each more than 20% of the global share of reserves, with the exact currencies - most often Germany ie the Euro, or the JPY - switching depending on the random shocks, but without adverse effects on all countries - including on the US even though the dollar loses its monopoly as reserve currency)\n",

    "#### Caveat\n",
    "\n",
    "Model incomplete. Among the many limitations of this model :\n",
    "\n",
    "- no military investment taken into account\n",
    "- no legacy beyond endowments\n",
    "\n",
    "Since they are the game changerss, paper examines how this incentivizes military investment to change the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that here all commands are interpreted by Octave instead of Matlab as the code is originally intended to. There are only two differences - the digraph function to plot the trade preference among countries graph, and the sprandsym (random initialization of the trade preference graph) function which is slightly more elaborate in Matlab. Both original Matlab codes and Octave code for these two points are explicit here (cell and cell), with more details if you want to copy paste the code and run in Matlab insteaed of here.* \n",

If rc is a vector of length n, then R has eigenvalues rc. Thus, if rc is a positive (nonnegative) vector then R is a positive (nonnegative) definite matrix. In either case, R is generated by random Jacobi rotations applied to a diagonal matrix with the given eigenvalues or condition number. "
